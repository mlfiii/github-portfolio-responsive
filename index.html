            Hello and welcome! Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Native to California, I grew up in Altadena. While in high school, I
            started working at the school library and participated in summer
            programs that led me to work for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It
            was at this program I started learning about working on computers
            firstly in Lotus 123. From there it was only natural to learn more!
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Over the years, I have enjoyed travel to various countries including
            Mexico, Canada, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, The Dominican Republic,
            the Bahamas, Italy, France and Austria. International travel has
            been an important part of expanding my life experiences as many
            cultures offer varied perspectives that have helped me to enjoy
            diversity.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            I have had the honor of attending and at the same time working at
            UCLA since 1987. For 5 years, I worked at UCLA in various positions
            putting myself through school in Spanish and Linguistics. To this
            day, I still enjoy speaking Spanish as well as working for UCLA;
            currently as the Manager of Life Sciences Application Development.
            My focus over the past years has been as an SQL programmer while my
            staff work as full stack programmers utilizing Visual Studio.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            I look forward to continued learning every day through books, apps
            such as Duolingo and yes, classes I take including Coding Bootcamp.
            2020 promises to be a spectacular year of learning and meeting new
            people. I hope you’re as enthused as I am!
